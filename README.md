# Uni_York_SMI
University of York - cleaning up data for analysis of severe mental illness.

Patient data, drawn from a variety of health and care settings across England, including both primary and secondary care providers, was cleaned up for future analysis using Pandas (Python 3). In addition to basic information about each patient, other information included severe mental ilness (SMI) diagnosis history and medical records. Due to the highly-sensitive nature of this data, no output is shown for the code that was run and none of the patient files are included.
