# Uni_York_SMI

Quality control and preliminary analysis of UK-wide patient data, drawn from a variety of health and care settings across England, using Pandas (Python 3). The overall aim of the project was to examine reasons for poor health outcomes in patients with severe mental illness combined with diabetes. In addition to basic information about each patient, other information included severe mental ilness (SMI) diagnosis history and medical records. Due to the highly-sensitive nature of this data, no output is shown for the code that was run and none of the patient files are included.
